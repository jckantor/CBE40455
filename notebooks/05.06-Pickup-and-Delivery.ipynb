    "This is a proof-of-concept model for a pickup and delivery service. The model describes how a set of drivers would handle a predetermined set of orders. Each order consists of a pickup location and delivery location with time windows. The drivers have home locations and commission periods during which they are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Location data is used to compute a distance matrix among all locations.  Drivers can pickup and deliver multiple orders. The  objective is to minimize total drive time, where drive time is a  proxy for total cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a proof of concept model. As such, a number of important features have not been included. Among these are\n",
    "\n",
    "* graceful handling of infeasibile solutions.  Currently the solver simply fails. The problem statement should be updated to include soft constraints for time windows.\n",
    "* car capacity constraints\n",
    "* priority weights for drivers, customers, and orders\n",
    "* time variable aggregation\n",
    "* additional modeling of subtour elimination constraints\n",
    "* allowing for multiple departures for the same car from the pickup locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important simplification was to model only a single departure time for each car from each location. A driver can pick up multiple packages from a location, and multiple drivers can service the pickup location, but this model provides for only a single visit for each driver to each location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The immediate priority should be handling feasibility, and performance testing for small and medium scale application.\n",
