    "The `gis` module is the representation of your GIS. Well, what is a GIS? A geographic information system (GIS) lets you visualize, question, analyze, and interpret data to understand spatial relationships, patterns, and trends. GIS benefits organizations of all sizes and in almost every industry. If you are new to GIS, [this is a good place to start](http://www.esri.com/what-is-gis).\n",

    "Your GIS can be one that is hosted with ArcGIS Online or on premises using an instance of ArcGIS Enterprise. What does a GIS consist of? A GIS is a collaborative environment that allows you to create, visualize, and share maps, scenes, apps, layers, analytics, and data. To know more about this concept, refer [here](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/what-is-agol.htm)."
