As shown in the screen shot below, from your Pro backstage, click on the 'Python' tab. Then click on 'Add Packages' button and type `arcgis` into the search bar.

    " * ArcGIS API for Python requires Pro 1.4 or later. If you are using Pro 1.3, please upgrade to 1.4 or later. If you cannot upgrade, you can still install the API by creating a new environment in conda with Python 3.5 or higher and install the API in that environment. However, if you follow this approach, you cannot use ArcPy and the API from the same Python environment. Instructions for this approach is below, type them one at a time in the Python Command Prompt:\n",

    " * Next download the latest version of the API from [Esri's channel on anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/Esri/arcgis/files) for your OS. For instance, if you are installing on Linux 64-bit, then download the package titled `linux-64/arcgis-1.0.1-py36_1.tar.bz2` into a known location.\n",
