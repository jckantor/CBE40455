    "The ArcGIS API for Python is a powerful, modern and easy to use Pythonic library to perform GIS visualization and analysis, spatial data management and GIS system administration tasks that can run both in an interactive fashion, as well as using scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "It enables power users, system administrators and developers to leverage the rich SciPy ecosystem for automating their workflows and performing repetitive tasks using scripts. It integrates well with the IPython Notebook and enables academics, data scientists, GIS analysts and visualization enthusiasts to share geo-enriched literate programs and reproducible research with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide describes how to use the ArcGIS API for Python to write Python scripts, incorporating capabilities such as mapping, query, analysis, geocoding, routing, Portal administration, and more. A great place to start developing once you've [installed the API](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/Install-and-set-up/) is to browse the [sample notebooks](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/sample-notebooks/)."
