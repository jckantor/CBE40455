    "## Geoprocessing environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Geoprocessing environment settings are additional settings that affect geoprocessing tools. These settings provide a powerful way to ensure geoprocessing is performed in a controlled environment where you decide things such as the processing extent that limits processing to a specific geographic area, a coordinate system for all output geodatasets, or whether Z or M values should be included with the geoprocessing results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only certain environment settings will be used by a given geoprocessing tool. To determine the environments that a tool will use, consult the tool's documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `arcgis.env` module has globals to store such environment settings that are common among all geoprocessing tools. The code snippet below sets the spatial reference of the output geometries to 4326 (WGS84) :"

    "## Logging and error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Geoprocessing tools log informative, warning and error messages using [logging facility](https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html) for Python. These messages include such information as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When the operation started and ended\n",
    "* The parameter values used\n",
    "* General information about the operation's progress (information message)\n",
    "* Warnings of potential problems (warning message)\n",
    "* Errors that cause the tool to stop execution (error message)\n",
    "\n",
    "All communication between tools and users is done with these log messages. Messages are categorized by severity and are logged at these different levels:\n",

For example, defining a coordinate system for a dataset that already has a coordinate system defined generates a warning. You can take action when a warning returns, such as canceling the tool's execution or making another parameter choice.</p></td></tr><tr class=\"align-middle\"><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><p id=\"GUID-EABB68CA-9063-4AD8-849A-4F3CCD02E7BB\">logging.ERROR</p></td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><p id=\"GUID-B44B04A0-42DB-4B3E-8B3A-95A4248F8451\">Error messages indicate a critical event that prevented a tool from executing.\n",
